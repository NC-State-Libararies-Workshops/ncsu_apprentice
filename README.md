# Apprentice

A lightweight framework for creating workshops using jekyll and markdown (mostly).
The concept is a good workshop will consist of 

- A strong hands on component
- Good online material to refer to both before and after the workshop
- A brief presentation to orient attendees
- Be organized 

The Apprentice framework is composed of 4 primary components.

1. A home page 
2. Online tutorial composed of _units_
3. A slide deck for presentations
4. Instructors notes
